# ðŸ¤‘Tradeview Alert BypassðŸ¤‘

ðŸ›‘IMPORTANTðŸ›‘: What you will need is a Tradeview account.

# 1. Setup

## All of the steps gonna happen the file called app.py

## Webook
First your gonna need your WEBHOOK URL, because I am using 3commas, it is this one: https://3commas.io/trade_signal/trading_view .
Now your gonna edit the varible urlofthepostlink to your webhook URL.

## Setting the password
Now your gonna edit the varible yourkey to a secure password so no one can steal your BOT.

## Entering the DISCRIPTION.
For this your gonna search in the file app.py for a part called json, here you want to enter your MESSAGE, But right now we only support JSON so not every bot will work.

## UPLOADING IT TO GIHUB
Make a New REPO important is it that it is private so no one can see your files, after that upload all of the edited files.

# 2. Launching it on Digital Ocean.
[watch this on how to host it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcB-GmhKK_4)

# 3. Entering it on Tradeview.
Now once you have done the setup, you have the IP/URL of the server.
192.168.2.1/tvluxalgo?key=YOURKEYHERE
You will now need to replace the IP address with the IP/URL of the SERVER.
Copy this over to Trade view and paste it to webhook. 

# ALL DONE YOUR NOW SET. Have fun trading and Dont forget to like

## future plans.
-support of other types than JSON
-automatic setup with no user input required.
